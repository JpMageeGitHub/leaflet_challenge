# leaflet_challenge

This is a demonstration of how leaflet, D3, and a geojson can be used to produce captivating and dynamic visualizations of important data.

I used openstreetmap for my layering of markers and gps data. I utilized the USGS website and their json endpoints to visualize the worldwide magnitude 1 and higher earthquakes that have occured in the past month. This will dynamically update every 5 minutes for the most recent data.

I played around with the styles to get a visual that I think was most attractive, moving the initial center over the US, getting the scalar for the magnitude to just the right point, and deciding on the monthly endpoint for the amount of data.
